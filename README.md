# Klados  
*'klados' - Greek for branch, offshoot*  
Like a branch from a tree, this macropad is designed to be an extension of your keyboard. 
This is version two of my macropad, made for [Hackpad](hackpad.hackclub.com) and now redesigned for [Reboot](reboot.hackclub.com). See the initial version [here](https://github.com/AethelVeritas/hackpad/tree/main/hackpadsOne%20Pad%20To%20Rule%20Them%20All).
